Pod, Replicaset, daemonset, replication controller, job, cronjob[Controller in kubernetes]
===========================================================================================

What is container?
Running instance of image

What is image?
It's a way to package application and depedancy

My requirement is:
I want to create one container with name Olu, with image nginx:1.2 and port 8080
docker run -itd -p 8080:8080 --name Olu nginx:1.2

I want to create similar 1000 container, then it fails

docker: Error response from daemon: Conflict. The container name "/Olu" is already in use by container "1f520a1b47ecc954097e7322c0067a74e8af76ddcd056fe8959162fd6f7c5c97". You have to remove (or rename) that container to be able to reuse that name.
See 'docker run --help'

Now, Unserstand that we have very large infrastucture. 5000 nodes, and 300000 container

What is Pod?
============
Pod is a container written in YAML formate. container in docker known as pod in kubenetes[Initial defination]

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:1.14.2
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80


Template to write kubernetes objects are-
apiVersion: 
kind: 
metadata:
spec:

controlplane $ kubectl get pods
NAME    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx   1/1     Running   0          111s
controlplane $ docker container ls
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED   STATUS    PORTS     NAMES
controlplane $ 


When we run the command kubectl get nodes, it will give me available nodes present.

controlplane $ kubectl get nodes
NAME                                   
STATUS   ROLES           AGE   VERSION
controlplane[Master node]              Ready    control-plane   10h   v1.28.1
node01[worker node/slave node]         Ready    <none>          10h   v1.28.1

My requirement: I want to create 1000 container that uses similar image.[Replica set]

To create stuffs in kuberntes: kubectl apply -f <YAML file>
To delete stuffs in kuberntes: kubectl delete -f <YAML file>

Daemonset: I want to run 1 pod 1 node[Antivirus, loggin tools]

Job: Generally, it's not recomemded to run pod directly, we run pod with same conditions, and it's known as Job

controlplane $ docker pull ubuntu
Using default tag: latest
latest: Pulling from library/ubuntu
aece8493d397: Pull complete

controlplane $ docker pull obuntu
Using default tag: latest
Error response from daemon: pull access denied for obuntu, repository does not exist or may require 'docker login': denied: requested access to the resource is denied
controlplane $ 

I want to retry 5 times before terminating the job[backofflimit=5]

Cronjob: It's run periodically.[I want to run my job everyminute]
