Today's topic is monitoring
===========================

Monitoring purpose is to take proactive action to prevent problem, and find root cause if issue is created

lets have a look in below table-

Student	Maths	Physics	Chemistry
Olu	80	67	67
Umesh	65	64	53
Vivek	45	65	44
Rajesh	44	87	65
Vijay	88	66	88


In the monitoring we have 3 things-

1) Data to be monitor: What data we want to monitor

2) If we have data in multiple places then Collect data in one place.[Master slave architecture]

3) Once you have data in 1 place then visualize it.

IN monitoring we have couple of monitoring tools like splunk, ELK...

In the splunk we have 3 components-

1) Splunk forwarder- Fowarding logs from node to cerntral server
3) Indexer- managing logs in cerntral server
3) Search head- visualizing the logs

How to install splubk:
======================
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 -e "SPLUNK_START_ARGS=--accept-license" -e "SPLUNK_PASSWORD=changeme" --name splunk splunk/splunk:latest

userid:admin, password:changeme


System design
=============
Once my cpu is greater than 80% add 1 more instance, and when utilization is less then 20% then remove 1 instance


Categrary of monitoring
=======================
CAT A: High priority applications that runs 24*7[ATM, OTP, Fecabbok, whatsapp...]
CAT B: These application are working on business hours only[Employee attendance biometric in bank]
CAT C: Application that are yet to develope or those are in pipeline[Not yet in use]
Hypercare: The application which is requiring attention/security[Sending money to ATM by bank]

SLA: service level agreement.

Key factor of any organization is log. log tell you each and everything what is happening. and you can store that log for future purpose also.
