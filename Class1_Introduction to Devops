Umesh, 12+yrs, Devops

Name, qualification, why devops? any idea about programming?


Agenda:
======
1) What is Devops?
2) Why we need Devops?
3) Traditional system, SDLC

Patrick Dubois is the father of Devops, and he defined devops as improvement in current system

Lets understand a current system, and scope of imprevment

Application: spring pet clinic[dog] > https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic

To design this application we need to follow SDLC[software development life cycle]

Plan: Which alogorithm and which programing language we are going to use?
      Options: C, C++, Java, .Net, Go, Python.....

Code: Here, you would be converting your thought[spring pet clinic] into  codding

Build: Any website has 2 things 1) Business logic[it's your idea], non business logic[Images/quotes], We combine business logicn with non business logic.

Example: Calculator[a+b, a-b, a*b, a/b] > Business logic
         Battry, screen, outer body[Non business logic]

Test: We would be testing the accuracy of our application.
      unit testing, interation tessting, system testing, regression testing, user acceptance testing

CMMI: Level 5 > CMMI Level 5 indicates that the organization has achieved all the specific goals defined in maturity levels 2, 3, and 4. It focuses on optimizing business processes through adopting incremental and innovative technological improvements.

Release: When we deployment of code other that production it's known as release

Deploy: When we deployment of code in production it's known as deploy

Operate: Day to maintenances

Moniotor: Keeping eye on system

Now, as a improvemnt you need improve on below part:
1) Cost[cost should be low]
2) Time to market[minimal]
3) Quality[should be high]

Development phase: Plan code Build test> Making application available on local

Operation phase: Management of user and application

if some one deposite money
balance = balance + deposite

int balance, deposite
balance = balance + deposite

lets my current balance is 50000, and someone deposited 50000, so my balance should be 1 lakh, but it showing like 34465

Range of integer[0 to 65535]

long balance, deposite [2147.......12 to 13 digit]
balance = balance + deposite


Devops Engineer responsibility:

1) Reducing the communication gap between Development and Operation team.
2) Reducing the cost
3) Improving qulaity
4) Reducing time to market


Next step:
1) Understanding Development mindset.[Agile]
2) Understanding Operation mindset.[Application support model]
