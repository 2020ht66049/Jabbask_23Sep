Ansible
=======

My requirement is I want to create master slave setup, and I want to perform all the operation from master only

*** Kubernetes is designed to support up to 5000 nodes. 

Suppose, I have 5000 boxes where I need to do migration from ubuntu 20.04 to 22.04

1) Manual approache
2) Automated way by configuration management

lets setup lab then we will talk further

1) Created 4 linux box in ubuntu, and given name to them like master, slave1/2/3.

ec2-50-17-33-155.compute-1.amazonaws.com
ec2-54-87-61-14.compute-1.amazonaws.com
ec2-54-211-204-17.compute-1.amazonaws.com
ec2-18-207-177-120.compute-1.amazonaws.com

2) We have logged in to all the servers with root access.

3) How to check if ansible is installed or not[MajorRelease.minorRelease.fix]
devops@ip-172-31-41-252:/root$ ansible --version
Command 'ansible' not found, but can be installed with:
apt install ansible-core  # version 2.12.0-1ubuntu0.1, or
apt install ansible       # version 2.10.7+merged+base+2.10.8+dfsg-1
Ask your administrator to install one of them.

after setup to check things on all agent
ansible -i /etc/ansible/hosts -m command -a "hostname" all

Step1: Change PasswordAuthentication to yes in /etc/ssh/sshd_config
sudo service sshd restart

Step2: sudo adduser devops

Step3: sudo vi /etc/sudoers and give Sudo permission to devops
devops   ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL

Step4: Login by devops user to master/nodes

Step5: Install ansible on master by devops user
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install software-properties-common
$ sudo apt-add-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible
$ sudo apt install ansible

Step:6 
ssh-keygen(On Master)
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub <user-id>@<x-host(slave-host-name) #These commands needs to run on Master

So, basic purpose it if we want to do anything in multiple server, so instead of doing in all the boxes we can do it in 1 command by ansible

Requirement: I want install nginx to all the server

devops@ip-172-31-41-252:/root$ nginx -v
Command 'nginx' not found, but can be installed with:
apt install nginx-core    # version 1.18.0-6ubuntu14.4, or
apt install nginx-extras  # version 1.18.0-6ubuntu14.4
apt install nginx-light   # version 1.18.0-6ubuntu14.4
Ask your administrator to install one of them.

to install nginx
apt-get update
apt install nginx-core -y

devops@ip-172-31-41-252:/root$ nginx -v
nginx version: nginx/1.18.0 (Ubuntu)

We have to important thing in ansible-

1) Adhoc commands>running command in ansible way
      hostname
      ansible -i[inverntory] /etc/ansible/hosts -m[module] command -a[argument] "hostname" all[server group]
2) Playbook> collection of commands written in a particular formate
      ansible-playbook -i[inverntory] /etc/ansible/hosts nginx_install.yml[yaml location that container configuration]
