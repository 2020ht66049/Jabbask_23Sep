3) By package manager
     apt install docker.io

How to read docker version > docker --version

Docker image defination
=======================
Packaging application and it's dependany to run it anywhere we create docker image.


How to create docker image:
===========================
1) To create docker image we need to create build-context where we would be writing the instruction to create docker image[refered as dockerfile]
       touch dockerfile

2) The first line of docker image should be 
       from <OS> Example: from ubuntu or from centos or from alpine

3) remaining commands should have below syntax
       cmd linux command

Example: Create a docker image to print hello world in terminal
       from ubuntu
       cmd echo "Hello world"

4) To create docker image run below command
        docker build -t <imagename> .

5) To run docker image
        docker run <image name>
        from ubuntu/centos/alpine
        cmd echo "Hello world"

6) to install any software use run statement in front of linux command
Exaple: Create a docker image to install git and java 17 in ubuntu OS, and print message that software are installed.
       
        vi dockerfile, and keep below instruction over their.
        
        from ubuntu
        run apt-get update
        run apt install openjdk-17-jre-headless -y
        run apt-get update
        run apt install git-all -y    
        cmd echo "software's are installed"


7) To change directory we are using cd command. in dockerfile it would be 
        run cd directory > workdir directory

# Create dockerfile for spring per clinic application
        from ubuntu
        run apt-get update
        run apt install openjdk-17-jre-headless -y
        run apt-get update
        run apt install git -y  
        run git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.git
        workdir spring-petclinic
        run ./mvnw package
        cmd java -jar target/*.jar

docker run -p 8080:8080 -idt image1
