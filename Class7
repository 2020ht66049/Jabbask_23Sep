docker tag local-image:tagname new-repo:tagname
docker push new-repo:tagname

When we are creating image we are getting below two commands-
docker tag local-image:tagname new-repo:tagname
docker push new-repo:tagname

docker push 2020ht66049/olu:tagname

docker tag image11 2020ht66049/image11:olu[Repostoryname:username]
docker push 2020ht66049/image11:olu

Tomorrow:
=========
--name ; -idt 
multistage docker build
Docker compose
Docker networking
docker on window's

When we are creating the container, container will get default name[Noun_verb]. and you you want to give name as per you the use --name in command line argument like below

vi dockerfile
FROM ubuntu
cmd echo "Hello-world"

docker build -t image1 .

docker run -idt --name ubuntucontainer image1

ubuntu $ docker run image1
hello-world
ubuntu $ docker run image1
hello-world
ubuntu $ docker run image1
hello-world
ubuntu $ docker container ls
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED   STATUS    PORTS     NAMES
ubuntu $ docker container ls -a
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS                      PORTS     NAMES

*** From 1 image we can create multiple container, and those may be replica of each other.

Size optimization of docker image: Suppose, my requirement is want to have a container that print hello-world

vi docker file
from ubuntu
cmd echo "Hello-wold"

vi docker file
from alpine
cmd echo "Hello-wold"

vi docker file
from centos
cmd echo "Hello-wold"


REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED              SIZE
image3       latest    1d0ecf15c853   7 seconds ago        231MB
image2       latest    919f219a13e4   42 seconds ago       7.34MB
image1       latest    0d3b4fe686d8   About a minute ago   77.8MB

alpine       latest    8ca4688f4f35   5 days ago           7.34MB
ubuntu       latest    3565a89d9e81   8 days ago           77.8MB
centos       latest    5d0da3dc9764   2 years ago          231MB

ubuntu $ docker run image1
Hello-wold
ubuntu $ docker run image2
Hello-wold
ubuntu $ docker run image3
Hello-wold

we alway need to use the base image with minimal size to optimize the docker images.

Multi stage docker build
========================
We are breaking docker image into 2 part within 1 dockerfile to optimize the size.

Multistage docker build for SPC
FROM ubuntu as mvn
RUN apt update
RUN apt install -y git
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt install openjdk-17-jre-headless -y
RUN git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.git
WORKDIR spring-petclinic
RUN ./mvnw clean package -DskipTests

FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt install openjdk-17-jre-headless -y
COPY --from=mvn /spring-petclinic/target/spring-petclinic*.jar /spring-petclinic.jar
CMD java -jar /spring-petclinic.jar

Purpose of image: 
================
1) To package application and dependancy within a image to run it anywhere. 
2) So, in realtime environment we need to do mutiple time application restart, and it may lead to downtime. to resolve this issue docker come with the concept, here you package your application with dependancy, so depenancy on operating system.


example: 
1) SO, let say you have centOS, and here you can run the windows image hapily


Docker compose: it like creating application with 2 or 3 images, but no one uses it in real time. Please refer https://docs.docker.com/compose/
                [No one uses it].

Docker networking: It is set of principles how docker can commnicate to another container. but we not using docker networking because we are running container in kubernetes, so in first class of kubernetes along with architecture we are going to discuss on this.

docker on window's: Same way we work with linux container microsoft has introduced container in windows from windows 10 onward.

Suppose my requirement is install git and java the run echo

[First way]
from ubuntu
run apt-get update
run apt install git -y
run apt-get update
run apt install default-jre -y
docker build -t image1 .

From image1
cmd echo "Hello-world"

[Another way]
from ubuntu
run apt-get update
run apt install git -y
run apt-get update
run apt install default-jre -y
cmd echo "Hello-world"

Best practies all the docker keywords used to create docker image must be cpaital letter
like run RUN, cmd CMD....
